# Focus Task Timer App

<h3>Currently it doesn't have any backend, like storage system. So all tasks reset after closing the app. Maybe I'll add that, in future. </h3>

This is a desktop app built with Electron.js that functions as a **focus timer** with a task list, where users can manage tasks with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This app is designed for Windows but can run on other platforms as well.
